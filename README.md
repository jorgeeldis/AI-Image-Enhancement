## Introduction

Image enhancement plays a crucial role in improving the visual quality of images, reducing noise, and increasing the level of details. This repository serves as a learning resource and experimentation ground for AI-powered image enhancement techniques. It covers various methods, such as:

- **Contrast Enhancement:** Techniques to adjust the contrast of an image, making it more visually appealing.
- **Denoising Algorithms:** AI-based denoising techniques to reduce noise from images.
- **Super-Resolution:** Enhancing image resolution using deep learning models.
- **Colorization:** AI-powered colorization of grayscale images.

## Installation

To run the Jupyter Notebooks in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) on your system if you haven't already.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/AI-Image-Enhancement.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the repository directory:

   ```
   cd AI-Image-Enhancement
   ```

4. Create a new Anaconda environment with the required dependencies:

   ```
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

5. Activate the newly created environment:

   ```
   conda activate ai-enhance
   ```

## Usage

After setting up the environment, launch Jupyter Notebook:

```
jupyter notebook
```

Open the Jupyter Notebook web interface in your browser, navigate to the `notebooks/` directory, and explore the various notebooks available. Each notebook covers a specific image enhancement technique, provides code examples, and explanations of the underlying AI algorithms.
